# Cryptography
Cryptography is the art of protecting information by transforming it into a
secure format, known as encryption, which only those with a special key can
decrypt and read. This process converts plaintext into a ciphertext to pre-
vent unauthorized access or alterations. 


In this repository, I worked on symmetric cryptography and hash functions.
## Symmetric Cryptography
In symmetric cryptography, it is used same key for encrypting and decrypting data.


The sender and receiver must both have the same key and keep it
confidential.


Generally faster and more efficient for encrypting large volumes of
data than asymmetric cryptography.


In this repo, it is worked on some well-known symmetric cryptography types as below :
- Casear Cipher
- Vigenere Cipher 
- Hill Cipher
- AES
- DES
## Hash Function
A hash function is an algorithm that transforms an input (or "message") into a fixed-size string of bytes, typically appearing random and unique.They are widely used in computer science for various applications like data integrity verification, password storage, and cryptographic security. It is also called one way function because it is easy to compute the hash value from the input data, but it is computationally infeasible to reverse the process and retrieve the original input from the hash value.


In this repo, it is worked with common hash functions :
- MD5
- SHA-256
